This project uses data from the bakeoff package in R to examine competitors across 10 series. Their age, challenge scores, and the descriptions of their entries have been graphed to see how each affects their overall results.\nAs it turns out, people who scored higher in the “Technical Challenge” round made it farther overall!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Series 1 had 6 episodes and Series 2 had 8, compared to the 10 from that point forward"
