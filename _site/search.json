Everything you (n)ever wanted to know about Love Production’s The Great British Bake Off is answered, using data from the bakeoff package in R. This data was streamlined and applied to graphs demonstrating certain factors’ effect on competition results.\nAs it turns out, people who scored higher in technicals made it farther overall!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Series 1 had 6 episodes and Series 2 had 8, compared to the 10 from that point forward"
