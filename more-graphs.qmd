The first thing that comes to mind when you think "baking show" is cake, but how much of it is there on GBBO?

### Signature Challenge

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(bakeoff)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

read_rds("cakes_sig.rds")
```

### Showstopper Challenge

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
read_rds("cakes_show.rds")
```
