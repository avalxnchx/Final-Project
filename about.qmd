## About Me
Hi! My name is Ava Ransbotham, and as of 2023 I'm a freshman at Newton South High School. I love swimming, writing, art... and graphs, apparently. email | avaransbotham@gmail.com

## About This Project
Github Repo | [link](https://github.com/avalxnchx/Final-Project)

This project was created for [Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/), a 4-week course that teaches you the basics of data science visualization (everything in this website I learned through it!).

I was inspired, of course, by my all time favorite comfort show, and this dataset: [bakeoff](https://bakeoff.netlify.app/)
