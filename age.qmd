## ... It's Just a Number!

With age, you can see it going both ways: younger people might know more new techniques, but older people may have had more experience and seen a wider variety of recipes.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(bakeoff)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

read_rds("age_vs_episodes.rds")
```

While the graph shows a slight decrease in episodes appeared as age increases, there are also fewer people above the age of 50 in the competition.

## The Number

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

read_rds("age-distribution.rds")
```
