## Challenges Crash Course

For those who don't watch the show... there are three challenges per episode:

 - "Signature": bakers are given a prompt and requirements ahead of time

 - "Technical": the judges choose a dish that all bakers must attempt to recreate with a pared down recipe. Bakers are scored from 1 (first) to however many bakers.

 - "Showstopper": basically the same as the signature, just at a bigger, more complicated scale

## Description Lengths of Signature Challenges

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(bakeoff)

read_rds("sig_desc_length.rds")
```

## Description Lengths of Showstopper Challenges

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(bakeoff)

read_rds("show_desc_length.rds")
```
