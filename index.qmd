What ingredients make a star baker? Do those pesky technical challenges *really* matter? Everything you (n)ever wanted to know about Love Production's *The Great British Bake Off*  is answered in graphs, using data from the **bakeoff** package in R.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(bakeoff)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
