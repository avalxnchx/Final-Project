title: "What is the recipe for success?"

BAFTA award winning show *The Great British Bake Off* has had different hosts and judges throughout the years, but it has remained a fan favorite since 2010. This project uses data from the **bakeoff** package in R to examine competitors across 10 series. Their age, challenge scores, and the descriptions of their entries have been graphed to see how each affects their overall results.

As it turns out, people who scored higher in the "Technical Challenge" round made it farther overall!

```{r}

*Note: Series 1 had 6 episodes and Series 2 had 8, compared to the 10 from that point forward*
